# react-native firestick example react-native-router-flux
Fork of the "Real life example of firestick app written in react-native" described in https://github.com/souhe/react-native-firestick updated with the **react-native-router-flux** routing package since **@expo/ex-navigation** is throwing errors and I can't find a way to fix them.
